# Simple HTTP Server

This is a simple HTTP server build in python using `sockets`, `threads` and `arparse`.
It was build to pass the ["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, you'll build a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients.

It is built on `python 3.11`. To run it, you can just `python app/main.py`.
